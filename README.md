# Data-Analysis-and-Model-Prediction-on-Patient-Data
This project analyses the data of many patients (approximately 2000). The first data contains
demographic and simple measurements (height, weight, etc). The second data also contains
the results of 5 medical tests ranging from 0 to 100. It also indicates
whether or not the patient has a disease (0=yes, 1=no). Both files have an ID for each patient which uniquely identifies the patient. Thus patient 34573 in the
first file is the same as 34573 in the second.

# Model Performance
The model performs reasonably well overall, with an accuracy of 85.43%. The confusion
matrix provides valuable insights into the model's performance and can help guide further
refinement or decision-making based on the model's predictions
